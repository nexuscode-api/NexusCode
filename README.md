# ⚡ NexusCode AI: The Unshackled Coding Agent

**NexusCode** is an autonomous AI agent for your terminal. It integrates seamlessly into your workflow, understands project context via LSP, and writes complex code. But that is not the main differentiator.

**The main difference is: You don't need API keys.**

We have unified access to all top-tier LLMs through our distributed **Nexus KeyPool™**. You get the power of Enterprise/Team plans completely free while participating in the Open Beta.

## 🚀 The Tech: Nexus KeyPool™ Rotator

At the core is our proprietary **KeyPool Rotator** engine. It aggregates and validates API keys in real-time from various sources:

* Promotional campaigns and startup grants.
* University educational quotas.
* Community Shared Keys.

The agent switches keys "on the fly." If a key hits a rate limit or runs out of tokens in the middle of a generation, NexusCode instantly swaps to a fresh key without breaking the context of your coding session.

## ⚠️ Fair Use Policy

Our resources are vast, but not infinite. To ensure stability for everyone, we use a dynamic traffic shaping system:

### 🚦 The Traffic Light System

* 🟢 **Green State:** Low network load. Unlimited access to heavy models (Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4o) with maximum speed.
* 🟡 **Yellow State:** Medium load. **Smart Rate Limit** is activated (15-30s cooldown between heavy requests) to ensure fair distribution.
* 🔴 **Red State:** Peak load. The system temporarily switches Free users to efficient, high-speed models (GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3-70b) until the pool recovers.

**BAN POLICY:** Any attempts to scrape keys, use the agent for DDoS attacks, or spam the API will result in an immediate **Hardware ID (HWID) Ban**.

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Closed Beta Countdown

We cannot maintain open access indefinitely due to infrastructure costs and key limits.

> **THE PROJECT WILL TRANSITION TO A "PRIVATE CLUB" ONCE WE REACH 50,000 ACTIVE USERS.**

* **Now:** Registration is open to everyone.
* **Future:** Once the cap is reached, download links will be removed.
* **Your Status:** By installing the agent now, you secure **Early Adopter** status, granting you lifetime access to the pool even after the doors close to the public.

## 📥 Installation (Releases)

To prevent platform takedowns, we do not publish NexusCode to npm or pip. Please download the binary files directly.

Navigate to the **[Releases](../../releases)** tab and download the executable for your OS:

* 🪟 **Windows:** `nexus-win64.exe`
* 🍏 **macOS:** `nexus-darwin-arm64` (Apple Silicon) or `nexus-darwin-amd64`

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

*NexusCode is an experimental tool for aggregating open access points. We do not hack AI provider systems. We utilize publicly available or community-shared access keys. By using NexusCode, you agree that service availability is not guaranteed 24/7 and depends on the status of the "Community Pool".*
